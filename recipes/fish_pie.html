		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			Step 1
			<p>
				Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut a small slit in
				each potato and place onto a baking sheet.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Step 2
			<p>
				Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a
				fork, about 1 hour 10 minutes.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			Step 3
			<p>
				While the potatoes are baking, melt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet
				over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until onion has softened
				and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in Cheddar cheese, cream,
				mustard, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
				frequently, until sauce is warm and Cheddar has melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
				Remove from heat.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			step 4
			<p>
				Place white fish and shrimp in a 3 1/2-quart oven-proof baking dish.
				Pour cheese sauce over the fish; stir until well combined.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			step 5
			<p>
				Scoop the flesh out of the baked potatoes and place in a large bowl;
				discard the skins. Add 4 tablespoons butter and season with salt and
				pepper. Mash with a fork until butter has melted and potatoes are
				smooth. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of the fish.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			step 6
			<p>
				Bake until sauce is bubbling and potato topping is golden brown, about
				55 minutes.
